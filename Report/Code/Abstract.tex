Eclipsing binaries allow for precise characterisation of stellar parameters: a use this Research Note applies in identifying targets in the LOPS2 field for calibration and further investigation by the PLATO mission. TESS and Gaia DR3 photometry of ten systems with little ellipsoidal effect and orbital periods $2.76-17.6$ days within LOPS2 were processed using \verb|Lightkurve| and fitted using \verb|jktebop|. Characterised parameters allowed for estimation of mass, age and absolute $G-$band magnitude, indicating most are solar-type, eight fulfil the PLATO P1 sample specification and ten are within the P5 criteria. Observed tidal effects and eccentricities are consistent with literature.
