\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
% This project was highly successful in finding multiple benchmark candidates for PLATO which are consistent with the parameters set by the mission. Our best candidates are TIC279087522, TIC63579446, TIC349059354 and TIC201497357. These are mainly solar-type stars which are low in magnitude ($4<G<5$), meaning this project was successful in attaining our aim and finding good benchmark candidates.

This project was successful in finding multiple benchmark candidates for calibration of PLATO which are consistent with the parameters set by the mission, fulfilling the aim. Our best candidates are TIC7695666, TIC349480507 and TIC80556181. These exhibit properties $\sim 1 \ M_{\odot}$ and $V<11\mathrm{\ mag}$. We therefore recommend these stars for further study.
